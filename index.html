                    <p>
                        As a university project we made an application called Tutee in a group of four. The main objective of the application is to pair up people who are interested in tutoring with people who are looking for tutors. The application provides filtering features that make it easier to find a suitable tutor for your needs, tutoring class reservation system, calendar features, and a chat for conversations. The application can be found in Google Play with the name Tutee.

                    <h3>MyMind</h3>
                    <p>
                        MyMind is a simple prototype application for reading news that I made for a company called Qvick. The prototype application focuses mainly on the visual side of the application and creating a smooth user experience for moving from the categories to reading the chosen article. As the application is only a prototype, the news only exist locally and it is not capable to fetch the news from a website or a database. The source code of the application can be found on my Github page.

                        A webpage for an imaginary food company made as an outcome of an Udemy web development course.  The main focus of the project was to build a beautiful reactive website that would provide the customers a pleasant user experience. The source code of the website can be found on my Github page.

                    <p>
                        Highway racing game was my first bigger university project made in a group of three. With the group we designed a 2D game in which the player is driving on a highway, dodging other cars, and avoiding to drop off from the game field. The game provides visual user interface, basic moving commands, sounds, and music. The source code of the game can be found on my Github page.
