Link to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/fungi-challenge-fgvc-2018/overview">Kaggle competition</a>. In the challenge I used transfer learning with the model Resnet34 with image augmentation and progressive resizing. In the testing set the final probability that the correct label was present in the top three predictions was 54%. During the project I learned a lot about using the fastai library, neural net training process and project organization.

                    <p> The idea in the project was to create an alternative automated method for finding relevant research articles. The idea of the project was to first find articles that match a given search query. After finding a list of relevant articles I went through their reference lists and counted the number of occurances for each reference. The most relevant articles were concidered to be the ones with most references. During the project I learned a lot about webscaping and about research article search engines.

                    <p>A project done in co-operation with Aalto University and Verto Analytics. The goal of the project was to create and implement a ML-model on mobile device for predicting user's physical activities. The model used sensor data gathered from the phone as an input and as an output it returned a physical activity like walking or sitting. In the project I worked as the scrum-master, but as I was also one of the most experienced developer's I helped with the Android and ML development.

                    <p>A Kaggle-challenge organized by FGVC5. The task was to develop an algorithm for fashion cloth multi-label classification. I participated to this challenge with a friend. We decided to re-train ResNet50 model for the task. We were satisfied with our process, but we encountered lot of problems concerning data quality and the amount of data. Due to these problems and our outcomes stayed quite modest. The main takeaways from this challenge were the constructive communication and techniques for multi-label classification.<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/filbt/fashion"> Github</a></p>

The main objective was to find a way to improve consumers' knowledge about the impact of their choices. To tackle this problem we created a gamified learning experience for high school kids about the lifecycle of a mobile phone. The project was done in a group of five. I took part in the planning phase and did most of the development needed for the project. The application was built using Angular 4 framework.

The prototype application focuses mainly on the visual side of the application and creating a smooth user experience for moving from the categories to reading the chosen article. As the application is only a prototype, the news only exist locally and it is not capable to fetch the news from a website or a database.

With the group we designed a 2D game in which the player is driving on a highway, dodging other cars, and avoiding to drop off from the game field. The game provides visual user interface, basic moving commands, sounds, and music.
